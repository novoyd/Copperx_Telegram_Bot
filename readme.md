# Design Choices
Ok so for design choices had to choose between telegraph and grammY ended up using going for grammY over telegraf 
## Telegram bot framework

1. grammY has very up-to-date implementations with the latest versions of the Telegram API.
2. Excellent and extensive documentation in contrast to Telegraf's autogenerated docs, which were fairly limited.
3. Also, Telegraf was backported from JavaScript, which adds very complex type definitions.
