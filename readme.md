# Design Choices
Ok so for design choices had to choose between telegraph and grammY ended up using going for grammY over telegraf 
## Telegram bot framework
1. grammY has very up to date implementations with the latest versions of the telegram api
2.Excellent and extensive documentation in contrast to telegrafs autogenerated docs over here which were fairly limited
3.Also telegraf was back ported from javascript which adds very complex type definitions

Current code is just the standard example code for the grammY bot
